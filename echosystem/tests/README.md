# EchoSphere Tests

This directory contains all automated tests for the EchoSphere project, ensuring code quality, reliability, and correctness.

Subdirectories may be organized by:
- `unit/`: For unit tests, testing individual functions, classes, or modules in isolation.
- `integration/`: For integration tests, testing the interaction between multiple components or services.
- `e2e/`: For end-to-end tests, simulating full user workflows.
- `performance/`: For performance and load tests.

We aim for high test coverage and will use frameworks like `pytest`.
Each module or service should ideally have a corresponding test suite.
CI/CD pipelines will execute these tests automatically.
