# Phase 1: AI Persona Analysis & Trait Extraction (MAIPP) - Technology Stack

This document outlines the proposed technology stack for the AI Persona Analysis & Trait Extraction (MAIPP) module in EchoSphere's Phase 1. Choices are based on MAIPP's requirements for complex data processing, AI model integration, scalability, and interaction with other EchoSphere components.

## 1. Primary Backend Language & Framework (for Orchestration)

*   **Choice:** **Python with FastAPI (or a robust workflow orchestrator like Apache Airflow/Kubeflow Pipelines if complexity grows significantly)**
*   **Justification:**
    *   **AI/ML Ecosystem:** Python is the de facto standard for AI/ML development, providing unparalleled access to libraries for NLP, voice processing, machine learning, and interacting with AI APIs.
    *   **FastAPI for Orchestration Service:** If MAIPP is implemented as a central orchestration service that calls out to various specialized AI model services (either internal or external), FastAPI's asynchronous capabilities are excellent for managing these I/O-bound calls efficiently. Its Pydantic integration aids in data validation for internal API calls.
    *   **Workflow Orchestrators:** For highly complex, multi-stage pipelines with dependencies, retries, and monitoring, a dedicated orchestrator might be more suitable:
        *   **Apache Airflow:** Mature, widely used, good for scheduling and managing batch-oriented workflows. Python-defined DAGs.
        *   **Kubeflow Pipelines:** Kubernetes-native, excellent for managing ML workflows, especially if components are containerized and run on Kubernetes.
    *   **Scalability:** Python applications (FastAPI or workers for Airflow/Kubeflow) can be containerized and scaled horizontally.
*   **Key Libraries/Tools (for FastAPI based orchestration):**
    *   **FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic:** Core framework.
    *   **`httpx`:** For making asynchronous HTTP requests to AI model APIs or internal microservices.
    *   **Cloud Provider SDKs (`boto3`, `google-cloud-aiplatform`, etc.):** For interacting with managed AI services.
    *   **Task Queues (e.g., Celery with RabbitMQ/Redis):** If individual analysis tasks within MAIPP need to be offloaded for asynchronous processing by specialized worker services.

## 2. AI Models & Services

MAIPP will integrate a suite of AI models and services. The choice depends on the specific task, performance, cost, and customization needs.

*   **A. Text Analysis:**
    *   **Large Language Models (LLMs):**
        *   **Choice:** **Google Gemini API, OpenAI API (GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo), Anthropic API (Claude 3 series).**
        *   **Justification:** State-of-the-art for semantic understanding, summarization, topic extraction, NER, relationship extraction, inferring complex patterns, and philosophical leanings. Access via managed APIs reduces infrastructure burden.
        *   **Usage:** Called via their respective Python SDKs or `httpx`.
    *   **NLP Libraries & Specialized Models:**
        *   **Choice:** **Hugging Face Transformers library (with models like BERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa, specialized classifiers).**
        *   **Justification:** Provides access to a vast range of pre-trained models for tasks like fine-grained sentiment analysis, emotion detection, text classification (e.g., specific tones, styles). Can be self-hosted for cost control or specific fine-tuning needs, or used via Hugging Face Inference Endpoints.
        *   **Usage:** Using the `transformers` Python library.
*   **B. Voice Analysis:**
    *   **Speech-to-Text (STT):**
        *   **Choice:** **OpenAI Whisper API/model, Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API.**
        *   **Justification:** High accuracy transcription is crucial. Whisper offers excellent performance across various audio qualities. Google STT provides robust features and language support.
        *   **Usage:** Python SDKs or `httpx`.
    *   **Voice Analytics (Emotion, Prosody, Metrics):**
        *   **Choice:** **Hugging Face Transformers (e.g., Wav2Vec2-based models for emotion), Librosa, Praat (via Python wrappers like `parselmouth`).**
        *   **Justification:** Hugging Face for pre-trained models for tasks like emotion recognition from audio. Librosa for extracting acoustic features (pitch, energy, formants). Praat (via `parselmouth`) for detailed phonetic and prosodic analysis.
        *   **Usage:** Python libraries. Some features might feed into custom ML models.
*   **C. Multimodal Analysis (Conceptual for advanced features):**
    *   **Choice:** **Google Gemini API.**
        *   **Justification:** Specifically designed for integrated processing of combined text, audio, image, and video streams, enabling more nuanced understanding (e.g., detecting sarcasm, understanding context from visuals).
        *   **Usage:** Python SDK.
*   **D. Image/Video Analysis (Limited scope in Phase 1, e.g., OCR from images/PDFs, basic scene context from video):**
    *   **Text Extraction (OCR):**
        *   **Choice:** **Google Cloud Vision API (OCR), Tesseract OCR (via Python wrappers like `pytesseract`).**
        *   **Justification:** Google Vision API for high accuracy managed service. Tesseract for an open-source option.
    *   **Conceptual Video Analysis (Scene/Object for context):**
        *   **Choice:** **Google Cloud Video Intelligence API, Amazon Rekognition Video.**
        *   **Justification:** Managed services for extracting scene information, object detection, which could provide context for other analyses (e.g., analyzing a meeting transcript alongside detected objects in the room).

## 3. Database for `RawAnalysisFeatures`

*   **Choice:** **MongoDB (Managed Service, e.g., MongoDB Atlas, AWS DocumentDB)**
*   **Justification:**
    *   **Flexible Schema:** The structure of `extractedFeatures` can vary significantly between different AI models and modalities. MongoDB's document model handles this heterogeneity easily.
    *   **Scalability:** MongoDB scales horizontally well, suitable for potentially large volumes of feature data.
    *   **Developer Experience:** Python drivers (`pymongo`, `motor` for async) are mature and easy to use. Querying JSON-like documents is intuitive for developers working with AI API responses.
    *   **Indexing:** Supports indexing on nested fields if specific raw features need to be queried frequently (though primary querying is expected by `userID` or `sourceUserDataPackageID`).
*   **Alternative:** Storing as JSON files in AWS S3 if queries are rare and volume is extremely high, using AWS Athena or a data lake solution for batch analysis. PostgreSQL with JSONB is also an option but might be less flexible for highly diverse feature structures if not all are known upfront.

## 4. Database for `ExtractedTraitCandidate`

*   **Choice:** **PostgreSQL (Managed Cloud Service, shared with UDIM metadata or separate instance)**
*   **Justification:**
    *   **Structured Data:** `ExtractedTraitCandidate` has a more defined, relational structure.
    *   **Relational Integrity:** Foreign key to `User` table. Conceptual links to PKG entities.
    *   **Querying Capabilities:** SQL allows for effective querying by `userID`, `status`, `traitCategory`, etc., which will be needed by the PTFI module.
    *   **JSONB Support:** Useful for `supportingEvidenceSnippets`, `originatingModels`, and `associatedRawFeatureSetIDs` attributes.
    *   **Transaction Support:** Important for atomic updates to trait candidate status during the refinement process.

## 5. Graph Database for Persona Knowledge Graph (PKG)

*   **Choice:** **Neo4j (Managed Service, e.g., Neo4j AuraDB) or Amazon Neptune**
*   **Justification:**
    *   **Relationship-First Model:** The PKG is inherently a graph, representing relationships between User, Traits, Concepts, Emotions, etc. Graph databases are optimized for traversing these relationships.
    *   **Query Languages (Cypher/Gremlin):** Specifically designed for graph queries, making complex relationship-based lookups (e.g., "find all traits influenced by user's interest in 'AI'") much more intuitive and performant than in SQL or NoSQL document stores.
    *   **Schema Flexibility (for properties):** While nodes and relationships have types (labels), their properties can be flexible.
    *   **AI/ML Integrations:** Many graph databases are developing integrations for graph embeddings and graph ML, which could be valuable in later phases for advanced PKG analysis.
*   **Key Libraries/Tools:**
    *   **Neo4j:** `neo4j` Python driver.
    *   **Amazon Neptune:** Typically uses Gremlin via `gremlinpython` or SPARQL.

## 6. Data Processing & Transformation Libraries (Python)

*   **Choice:** **Pandas, NumPy**
*   **Justification:**
    *   **Pandas:** For data manipulation, cleaning, and transformation, especially if features are initially tabular or need aggregation before storage or further analysis.
    *   **NumPy:** For numerical computations, often a dependency for other data science and ML libraries.
*   **Usage:** Preprocessing data for AI models, post-processing model outputs, structuring features.

## 7. Secure Data Handling & Decryption

*   **Choice:** Integration with **AWS KMS (or chosen KMS from UDIM stack)** via **Boto3**.
*   **Justification:**
    *   MAIPP needs to request decryption of `UserDataPackage` raw data. This involves using the `encryptionKeyID` stored by UDIM and making authorized calls to the KMS to decrypt the data key, then using that to decrypt the content from S3.
    *   Security is paramount; direct interaction with KMS via its SDK within a secure execution environment is the correct approach.
*   **Usage:** The MAIPP orchestration logic will include steps to call KMS for decryption operations, ensuring it has the necessary IAM permissions. Decrypted data should be handled ephemerally in memory or secure temporary storage.

## 8. Containerization & Orchestration (Deployment Environment)

*   **Choice:** **Docker & Kubernetes (consistent with UDIM)**
*   **Justification:**
    *   **Docker:** To package MAIPP orchestration services and any self-hosted AI model inference services (e.g., Hugging Face models) into containers.
    *   **Kubernetes:** To deploy, scale, and manage these services. Kubernetes is particularly useful if MAIPP involves multiple microservices for different analysis tasks or if GPU resources are needed for self-hosted models (via Kubernetes device plugins).
    *   **If using Kubeflow Pipelines:** Kubeflow itself runs on Kubernetes.

## 9. (Optional) Specialized Task Queues / Workers for Intensive AI Tasks

*   **Choice:** **Celery with RabbitMQ or Redis (if not using a full workflow orchestrator like Kubeflow)**
*   **Justification:**
    *   Some AI analyses (e.g., processing a very long document with an LLM, or a large audio file) can be time-consuming.
    *   To prevent blocking the main MAIPP orchestration flow or API (if MAIPP exposes one for specific re-analysis tasks), these tasks can be offloaded to Celery workers.
    *   RabbitMQ or Redis would act as the message broker for Celery.
*   **Note:** This adds complexity. The need depends on the synchronous vs. asynchronous nature of the AI model calls and the overall processing time targets for a `UserDataPackage`. Using fully managed AI services via API often negates the need for self-managed Celery workers for those specific calls, as the API provider handles the scaling.
