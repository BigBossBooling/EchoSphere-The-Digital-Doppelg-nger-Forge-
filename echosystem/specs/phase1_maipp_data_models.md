# Phase 1: AI Persona Analysis & Trait Extraction (MAIPP) - Data Models

This document specifies the data models for the AI Persona Analysis & Trait Extraction (MAIPP) module as part of EchoSphere's Phase 1. These models define the structure for storing intermediate analysis outputs, identified trait candidates, and the core Persona Knowledge Graph (PKG).

## 1. `RawAnalysisFeatures` Data Model

**Objective:** To define the structure for storing intermediate, modality-specific features extracted by various AI models from a `UserDataPackage`. This data serves as the direct output of individual AI analyses before features are synthesized into `ExtractedTraitCandidate`s. It's valuable for debugging, traceability of trait origins, and potentially for future AI model retraining or refinement.

**Storage Consideration:**
Given the potentially large volume, varied structure, and the fact that some of this data might be temporary or primarily for debugging/traceability, a **Document Database (e.g., MongoDB)** or **Cloud Object Storage (e.g., AWS S3 with JSON files)** is suitable.
*   **MongoDB:** Offers flexibility for the `extractedFeatures` JSONB-like structure, good for querying specific feature sets if needed for diagnostics.
*   **S3 with JSON files:** Cost-effective for large volumes, especially if features are extensive. Files can be named by `featureSetID`. Querying specific features across many files is harder but can be done via batch processing or data lake tools if loaded there.
For Phase 1, **MongoDB** is preferred for easier ad-hoc querying during development and debugging, with a view to archiving to S3 for long-term retention if needed.

## 2. `ExtractedTraitCandidate` Data Model

**Objective:** To define the structure for a potential persona trait identified by AI analysis. These candidates are then presented to the user for review and refinement via the Persona Trait Finalization Interface (PTFI). This data forms the bridge between raw AI output and the user-curated Persona Knowledge Graph.

**Storage Consideration:** A **Relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL)** is suitable here, alongside UDIM's `UserDataPackage` metadata, as it allows for structured querying, clear relationships to `User`, and well-defined ENUM types for `traitCategory` and `status`. It will also link to the PKG (conceptually, if not via hard FKs initially).

## 3. Persona Knowledge Graph (PKG) Detailed Structure

**Objective:** To define the nodes, relationships (edges), and properties for the graph database that represents the structured, interconnected, and user-refined understanding of the persona. This is the core, evolving model of the Echo.

**Graph Database Choice (Reiteration):** **Neo4j** or **Amazon Neptune** are strong candidates due to their maturity, Cypher/Gremlin query languages, and scalability. For this specification, Neo4j/Cypher conventions will be used for property examples.

**Node Types (Labels):**

*   **`User`**
    *   Properties:
        *   `userID`: UUID (Primary Key, Indexed, NOT NULL) - Links to the main User table.
        *   `did_user`: STRING (Indexed, NULLABLE) - User's Decentralized Identifier (from Phase 4).
        *   `createdAt`: DATETIME (NOT NULL).
*   **`Trait`**
    *   Properties:
        *   `traitID`: UUID (Primary Key, Indexed, NOT NULL) - Can be same as `ExtractedTraitCandidate.candidateID` if directly confirmed, or new if user-defined.
        *   `name`: STRING (Indexed, NOT NULL) - User-confirmed or user-defined name for the trait (e.g., "Detail-Oriented," "Sarcastic Wit," "AI Ethicist").

        *   `status`: STRING (Indexed, NOT NULL, ENUM: ['active', 'dormant', 'experimental'], DEFAULT 'active') - 'active' means it influences Echo behavior.
        *   `confidence`: FLOAT (NULLABLE, 0.0-1.0) - User's or system's confidence in this trait's representation.
        *   `origin`: STRING (NOT NULL, ENUM: ['ai_confirmed_user', 'ai_refined_user', 'user_defined', 'derived_system']) - How the trait was established.
        *   `lastRefinedTimestamp`: DATETIME (NOT NULL).

**Indexing Strategy for PKG:**
*   Index primary keys for all node types (`userID`, `traitID`, `conceptID`, etc.).
*   Index frequently queried properties like `Trait.name`, `Trait.category`, `Concept.name`, `Emotion.name`, `Interest.name`, `Skill.name`.
*   Consider composite indexes if certain combinations of properties are often queried together.
*   Graph databases automatically index nodes by label and handle relationship traversals efficiently.

## 4. Consent Linkage and Verification in MAIPP

**Logic Flow (Brief):**
MAIPP's interaction with consent is primarily one of *verification* before processing data.

1.  **Receive Processing Task:** MAIPP receives a task to process a `UserDataPackage` (referenced by `sourceUserDataPackageID`). This task includes the `packageID` and implicitly the `userID`.
2.  **Retrieve `consentTokenID`:** MAIPP fetches the `UserDataPackage` metadata from the UDIM database (or receives it as part of the task) to get the `consentTokenID` associated with this data.
3.  **Determine Required Scope:** For each specific AI analysis it intends to perform (e.g., "text_sentiment_analysis_on_package_content," "voice_prosody_extraction_from_audio_package"), MAIPP determines the precise `requiredScope` string/object. This scope must be pre-defined and understood by the Consent Management system.
4.  **Call Consent Verification API:** MAIPP (or a dedicated sub-service it uses) makes an internal API call to the Universal Consent Management Service (UCMS) endpoint (e.g., `GET /internal/consent/v1/verify`). The request includes:
    *   `userID`
    *   `consentTokenID`
    *   The specific `requiredScope` for the analysis about to be performed.
    *   Optionally, `dataHash` of the content if consent is tied to specific data hashes and MAIPP can compute/retrieve it.
5.  **Evaluate Consent Response:**
    *   If the Consent Verification API returns `{"isValid": false, ...}`, MAIPP **must not** perform that specific analysis. It should log this denial and may skip this part of its pipeline for the given `UserDataPackage`.
    *   If `{"isValid": true, ...}`, MAIPP proceeds with the authorized AI analysis.
6.  **Granular Enforcement:** This check is performed for *each distinct type of processing* that requires a separate consent scope. One part of a package might be processed (e.g., text extraction from PDF) while another is skipped (e.g., sentiment analysis on that text) if consent scopes differ.

**Data Linkage:**
*   `RawAnalysisFeatures` and `ExtractedTraitCandidate` records in MAIPP's databases are linked to the `sourceUserDataPackageID`.
*   The `UserDataPackage` record (managed by UDIM) contains the `consentTokenID`.
*   This indirect linkage ensures that all MAIPP-generated data can be traced back to the data package and, through it, to the consent that authorized its initial collection and by extension, its processing (if scopes align). No direct Foreign Key from MAIPP models to `ConsentLedgerEntry` is strictly necessary as the verification is a live API call based on the `consentTokenID` from the `UserDataPackage`.

## 5. Overall Storage Considerations for MAIPP Data

*   **`RawAnalysisFeatures`:**
    *   **Choice:** MongoDB (or similar Document DB).
    *   **Rationale:** High volume, potentially deeply nested and varied JSON structures for `extractedFeatures` make a document database ideal for flexibility and ease of ingestion. Performance for writing individual feature sets is good. Querying specific features across many documents is feasible for debugging or targeted analysis.
    *   **Long-term/Archival:** Large raw feature sets, if needed for extensive model retraining over long periods, could be periodically ETL'd into a data lake (e.g., S3 + Parquet/Delta Lake) for cost-effective storage and batch processing.
*   **`ExtractedTraitCandidate`:**
    *   **Choice:** PostgreSQL (alongside UDIM's `UserDataPackage` metadata).
    *   **Rationale:** Structured data with clear relationships (to User), ENUM types for status/category, and need for transactional integrity during status updates. Good querying capabilities for the PTFI module to retrieve candidates by `userID` and `status`. JSONB support for `supportingEvidenceSnippets` and `originatingModels` is beneficial.
*   **Persona Knowledge Graph (PKG):**
    *   **Choice:** Dedicated Graph Database (e.g., Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, TigerGraph).
    *   **Rationale:** The PKG is fundamentally about relationships between entities (User, Traits, Concepts, etc.). Graph databases are optimized for traversing these relationships (e.g., "find all traits related to 'AI' concepts for this user," "show evidence for this trait"). They provide query languages (Cypher, Gremlin) specifically designed for these tasks, which would be complex and inefficient in relational or document databases at scale.
