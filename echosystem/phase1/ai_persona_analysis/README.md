This module handles the AI-driven processing of raw user data. It aims to extract linguistic patterns, tone, sentiment, philosophical leanings, and other relevant traits.

Key functionalities:
- Processing of multimodal data (text, voice, potentially visual).
- Leveraging various AI APIs (e.g., Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, Hugging Face models) for specialized analysis.
- Construction of a Persona Knowledge Graph (PKG) to store extracted attributes and traits.

Core principles: Deep Understanding, Nuance Capture, Knowledge Structuring.
