# EchoSphere Utilities

This directory contains utility modules and helper functions that are used across different parts of the EchoSphere system. These utilities are designed to be general-purpose and support various components.

Examples might include:
- `privacy_protocol.py`: For managing consent and privacy-enhancing techniques.
- Encryption helpers
- Data validation tools
- Common logging configurations
- String manipulation or data conversion functions

The aim is to promote code reuse and maintain a clean separation of concerns.
