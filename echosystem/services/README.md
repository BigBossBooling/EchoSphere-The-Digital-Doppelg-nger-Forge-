# EchoSphere Services

This directory will house the code for distinct microservices or larger service components that make up the EchoSphere backend. Each service typically encapsulates a specific domain of functionality.

Examples of services could include:
- User authentication service
- Data processing and AI analysis pipelines (as services)
- Persona management service
- Communication interface service (for Echo interaction)
- API gateways

Each subdirectory within `services/` might represent an individual service, containing its own handlers, logic, and potentially Dockerfile for containerization.

The aim is to build a modular, scalable, and maintainable backend architecture.
